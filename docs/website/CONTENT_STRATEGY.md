```

**Icons:**

```

### Link Text

### Headings

## Multilingual Considerations (Future)

Currently English-only. If adding languages:

1. **Prioritize:** Hindi, then other Indian languages
2. **Localize:** Not just translate - adapt for culture
3. **Maintain:** Same tone and voice in all languages
4. **Technical:** Use i18n routing, not separate sites

## Content Approval Process

For major content changes:

1. Draft content in markdown
2. Review for tone, clarity, accuracy
3. Check SEO implications
4. Test on staging (if available)
5. Get feedback from team/users
6. Deploy to production
7. Monitor user feedback
